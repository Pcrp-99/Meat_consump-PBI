## About Dashboard

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global meat consumption trends from 1990 to 2022. It allows you to visualize consumption patterns for four major meat categories: beef, pork, poultry, and sheep. By applying various filters (meat type, year, or country), you can explore specific data points and gain valuable insights into global meat consumption habits. Consumption quantities are presented in KG/CAP for easy comparison.
